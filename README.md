# Project-2-of-Ice-and-Fire

##The approach taken/app walkthrough

Access API containing basic information on the books, houses and characters of George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” fantasy book series.

Allows users to create categories to help them remember who all the characters are and where their allegiances lie

Users can search for characters by their name, the API confirms if the spelling is correct, then user can choose to add that character to a new category.

Users can see list of all categories, edit a category's name, create a new one, or delete one.

##Unsolved problems

1. Auth does not work
2. Deleting category does not re-render list of categories, page must be re-loaded
3. Categories can't be deleted once a character is owned by that table
4. Characters can't be edited or deleted out of a category
5. Poor styling, design, explanataion in app
